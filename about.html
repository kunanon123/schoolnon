              <p>Hancock High began on Tuesday December 13, 1955 with the creation of the Hancock County School District and the consolidation of the following community school districts : Sellers, Dedeaux, Kiln, Leetown, Caesar, Catahoula, Flat Top, Aaron Academy, Gainesville, Logtown, Gulfview, and Clermont Harbor. Next, on Friday March 7, 1958, the Hancock Board of Education approved the bids for the construction of what would become Hancock North Central for a total of $375,953.84 to be completed for the 1958-1959 school year. Construction began and was completed at the end of the 1959 school year. As a symbolic gesture of the newly created school district, one district graduation was held on the Hancock North Central campus with 34 students present; it was the beginning of our long and historic journey. Classes began on August 28, 1959, marking the opening of the new 1st-12th grade state of the art campus. A rich tradition of excellence and pride grew as Hancock County and Hancock North Central continued to grow. In 1987, the Hancock County Board of Education had a vision of creating a more modern facility that would be more centrally located and that could meet the needs of the quickly growing county. Hancock High was born. Our current facility on Stennis Airport Drive was constructed and completed for the 1990-1991 school year at a cost of $9.2 million. Classes that August with an enrollment of 1000 students in grades 7th-12th being served and the first graduation was held in May of 1991 with 117 graduates participating. Hancock High has a continued to grow in prestige and population, becoming one of the top high schools in the state of Mississippi. Today, Hancock High has a student population of almost 1300 students in grades 9 through 12 and is the 14th largest high school in the state of Mississippi.</li>
